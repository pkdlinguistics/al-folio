For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

<!-- pages/projects.md -->
<div class="projects">

<object data="{{ site.url }}/teaching/_pdfs/pkdassignment.pdf" width="1000" height="1000" type="application/pdf"></object>
<!-- <object data="../assets/path/to/document.pdf" width="1000" height="1000" type='application/pdf'></object> -->
</div>
Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!
